how to install and run project:
- Unzip the file, then go into "web" folder, open VS code, open terminal (4 if needed, each terminal for each App)
- Change directory to each folder and write "npm install" (for example, if you are at "FStack-asm2-backend", write "npm install", then do it with the other folder like "FStack-asm2-customer_frontend"). If inside each folder have a "node_modules"
- After installing successfully, "npm start" to start the web. Start each folder separately, do it like "npm install". Go to terminal and write "npm start" at each directory
- The backend will have the port of 8000, and then the first frontend app that you choose to start will have the port of 3000 or "localhost:3000". When you start the other web it will ask to choose different port. Click "y" and enter, the second port will be 3001 and the third will be 3002
